        <h1>Calculations/Research</h1>
        <p>One of my first big projects when I was working with my design team, UTAT, was creating a tool that could be used to graph the temperature distribution of a nose cone given the dimensions of the nose cone. To start I had to do some research on equations that I could use to model the temperature distribution across the nose cone. I also had to discretize these equations. Parts of my discretization are shown in Figure 1. I also wrote a pseudo code, which acted as a prototype to what the actual code would be, also shown in Figure 1. The equations that I had to use for my code, as well as a brief explanation of how to use the code is shown in Figure 2 and 3 respectively. The figures also act as a link to the github readme where my code is located and also where I wrote the complete explanation to how my code works. As I presented my code to my lead, Ethan Rajah, he told me that the equations I used were taught in the Engineering Science second year Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer course, which helped increase the credibility of my code.

            <h1>Graphs of Heat Flux and Temperature Distribution of the Nose Cone</h1>
            <p>
                Since this was my first time making something like this, I had to make sure it made sense. To do so, I plotted the data that the code outputted for the temperature distribution across the nose cone, as well as the heat flux experienced by the nose cone over time. The heat flux rises sharply as the rocket reaches motor burnout, as shown in Figure 4. This is what I expected to happen from research. The temperature at the tip of the nose cone is also much higher than the temperature at the ends of the nose cone, as shown in Figure 5, which was also expected. The max temperature gave an output of around 200 degrees celsius. Since the rocket does not go up to hypersonic speeds, a relatively low temperature around 200 degrees celsius made sense.
